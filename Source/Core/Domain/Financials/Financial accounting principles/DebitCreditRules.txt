In financial accounting debit and credit are simply the left and right side of a T-Account respectively. 
They are used to indicate the increase or decrease in certain accounts. 
When there is a change in an account, that change is indicated by either debiting or crediting that account according to following rules:

Assets and Expenses 
An increase is recorded as debit (left side) 
A decrease is recorded as credit (right side) 

Liabilities, Equities and Revenues 
A decrease is recorded as debit (left side) 
An increase is recorded as credit (right side) 

Contra-accounts 
Contra-accounts behave exactly in opposite way to the respective normal accounts.

Examples:

The owner brings cash from his personal account into the business 
Analysis: 
Cash (an asset) is increased thus debit Cash 
Owner capital (an equity) is increased thus credit Owners' Capital
Office supplies are purchased on account 
Analysis: 
Office Supplies (an asset) is increased thus debit Office Supplies 
Accounts Payable (a liability) is increased thus credit Accounts Payable
Wages payable are paid

Cash (an asset) is decreased thus credit Cash
Revenue is earned but not yet received 
Analysis:
